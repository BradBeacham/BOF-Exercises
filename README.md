# BOF-Exercises
None of these exploits were discovered by me, this is simply a repo where I store the exploits I've written while undertaking various tutorials online.

Take what i've written with a grain of salt.  I try to keep stuff in here limited to working exploits, but some may be in process or i've simply moved onto something else!  Unless I mention it otherwise, shellcode will generally only spawn calculators.

Each exploit should have a reference to the associated tutorial, if not, it's either one of the first ones I wrote or I simply forgot.  

May thanks to the following people for their fantastic resources!  Without you guys, the learning process would have been much steeper.
